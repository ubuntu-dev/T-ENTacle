TODO: write close function, put load and save in utils

Once a pattern has been learned, should it be removed from current patterns? For example,
if a user selects a pattern for "Average Pressure", and that pattern is left in current patterns,
it could be suggested again for something like "Max Pressure". This could be good in the case
of multiple possible matches, or bad if we desire uniqueness. There could be a flag to specify...
