right now, works on one document at a time, but could move patterns dataframe to a class variable 
so that all instances can modify it. But it seems like a better idea to concatenate the output from several
instances, or to set up some sort of inheritance structure. 

Check for entities like currency, date, numbers
See if there is a better way to tokenize with spacy or something

TODO: 
keep dictionary of pattern objects, key is id
1. consider making threshold mutable by the user
2. currently filters out patterns that don't have numbers. Are there any strings that should be left in?
3. add a way for user to add seed aliases
4. Think about the flow of when patterns are added to allpatterns. This should probably occur after a user is finished processing
    the current patterns.

        learned than only one. The score is boosted by matching units, and the score is boosted if a multi-part entity
